# Password-Manage-App

## Motivation
I created this project to brush up on my python knowledge and create a user interface using python Kivy and Kivy MD. The idea was to create an application that works as a manager for passwords. There is no encryption. I implemented file encryption in the [Trezor](https://github.com/imiskii/Trezor) project.

## What it does ?

The main part of the application is divided into 4 parts:
* Accounts
* Games
* Emails
* Licenses

The data is loaded from the ```.json``` file, which is in the ```data/data.json``` directory. In the application, it is possible to create a new record, delete existing records or edit existing records and generate random password.

## How you can use it ?

You just need to create a ```data.json``` file in the ```data/``` directory and have python, kivy and kivy md installed.
